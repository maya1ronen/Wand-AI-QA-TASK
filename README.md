# Wand-AI-QA-TASK: MAYA RONEN

Web App Tested
**Sauce Demo** 
**Link:** [https://www.saucedemo.com/]

## Public APIs Tested
**ReqRes:**  [https://reqres.in]

These APIs were used to practice GET and POST requests, test response codes, validate expected data, and testing positive, negative, and edge cases.

## AI Agent Used
**ChatGPT Free Tier** – used for AI evaluations through 8 prompts. 

## Time Spent
Approximately 17 hours.

## Assumptions
1. The Sauce Demo web app is stable and fully functional during testing.  
2. Public APIs are available and returning correct responses.  

## Constrains/ Notes
1. Following the interview context, my experience is primarily in manual testing; therefore, no automation tests were performed or suggested. E2E tests on the Web App were planned and performed manually; API tests were included via Postman and were executed manually.
2. Due to time constraints, a separate Test Strategy document for the APIs and the Agent was not created. I focused on preparing one detailed and professional document for the Web App, which can be assumed to have a similar structure for other components with updated data relevant to each tested platform.
3. Section 6, the lightweight Performance/Resilience Plan, was not fully clear. If additional time had been available, I would have requested clarification. Currently, it is not included in this assignment.
